## How to Test

   - Go to `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select `c:\dev\EcomFlow\apps\extension\dist`
3. **Add a test Amazon URL** to Bulk Lister
4. **Click Opti-List** (or Seo/Standard)
5. **Watch the console logs** to see each step

## Debugging Commands

### Check Storage:
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(null, (data) => {
  console.log('All storage:', data);
  // Look for scrapedProduct_0
  if (data.scrapedProduct_0) {
    console.log('Title stored:', data.scrapedProduct_0.title);
    console.log('Search title:', data.scrapedProduct_0.searchTitle);
  }
});
```

### Clear Storage:
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.clear(() => console.log('Storage cleared'));
```

### Check if Automation Running:
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(['automationInProgress', 'automationStep'], (data) => {
  console.log('Automation status:', data);
});
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Amazon tab doesn't close
**Fix**: Check console for errors. The tab should close automatically after eBay opens.

### Issue: eBay search box not found
**Fix**: 
1. Check if you're on the correct eBay page: `ebay.com/sl/sell?sr=shListingsCTA`
2. Console will show which selector was tried
3. Inspect the search box element and verify the selector

### Issue: Title not pasted
**Fix**:
1. Check console logs for "üìù Pasted title into search box"
2. Verify storage has the title: Run debugging command above
3. Look for "searchTitle" or "title" field in scrapedProduct_0

### Issue: Enter key doesn't work
**Fix**:
- The script tries 3 different Enter key events (keydown, keypress, keyup)
- If none work, eBay's search form might be using a different submit method
- Check for a search button and try clicking it instead

## Visual Indicators

‚úÖ **Green notifications** = Success at each step
üü¢ **Light green search box** = Title pasted successfully
üìù **Console logs with emojis** = Easy to track progress

## Expected Timeline

- Amazon page load: ~2 seconds
- Scraping: ~1 second
- Storage save: ~0.5 seconds
- Tab close + eBay open: ~1 second
- eBay page load: ~3 seconds
- Search box fill + Enter: ~0.5 seconds
- **Total: ~8 seconds per product**

## Next Steps After Testing

If everything works:
1. ‚úÖ Try with multiple URLs (will process one at a time)
2. ‚úÖ Test all three list types (Opti/Seo/Standard)
3. ‚úÖ Verify form auto-fill with different products
4. ‚úÖ Check price calculation based on list type

If something doesn't work:
1. Share console logs
2. Share screenshot of the search box element
3. Share which step failed
