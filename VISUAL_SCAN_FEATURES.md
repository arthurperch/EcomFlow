# 🎨 Visual Scan Features - SOLD Data Overlay

## New Features Added

### 1. **Visual Sold Count Overlays** 📊
When scanning eBay seller stores, each product image now displays a **large transparent number** showing the sold count directly on the image.

**Features:**
- ✅ Big green circular badge over product images
- ✅ Shows actual sold count number (e.g., "48", "127", "1,234")
- ✅ Transparent overlay (85% opacity)
- ✅ Animated pulse effect when appearing
- ✅ Only appears on products with sales data
- ✅ Doesn't interfere with clicking or navigation

**Visual Style:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Product Image     │
│                     │
│      ╭─────╮       │  ← Green circular badge
│      │ 48  │       │     with sold count
│      ╰─────╯       │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Real-Time Scan Progress Indicator** ⏳
A centered modal overlay shows scanning progress in real-time.

**What You'll See:**
- 🔄 Animated spinning loader
- 📊 "Scanning Products..." header
- 🟢 **Big green number** showing products with sales found
- 📈 Current progress: "Scanning X of Y"

**Example Display:**
```
╔═══════════════════════════════╗
║    🔄 (spinning animation)     ║
║                               ║
║   Scanning Products...        ║
║                               ║
║           48                  ║  ← Big number of sold items found
║                               ║
║  Products with sales found    ║
║                               ║
║    Scanning 23 of 60         ║
╚═══════════════════════════════╝
```

### 3. **SOLD Data Only Filtering** ✅
The Competitor Research page now **only displays products with actual sold data**.

**Changes:**
- ✅ Header updated: "SOLD ITEMS ONLY"
- ✅ Filter: `soldCount > 0` (must have sales)
- ✅ Results section: "📦 SOLD Items Results (X products with sales data)"
- ✅ Green badge: "✅ Showing only products with verified sold data from eBay"
- ✅ Log messages emphasize "SOLD products"

## How It Works

### During Scan:
1. **Page loads** → Progress modal appears
2. **Each product scanned** → Green sold count overlay added to image
3. **Progress updates** → Modal shows: "Scanning X of Y", counts increase
4. **Scan completes** → Progress modal disappears after 1 second
5. **Results display** → Only products with `soldCount > 0` shown

### Visual Flow:
```
User clicks "Run"
    ↓
Progress modal appears: "Scanning 0 of 60... 0 products found"
    ↓
Product 1 scanned → Image gets overlay badge "48"
    ↓
Progress updates: "Scanning 1 of 60... 1 product found"
    ↓
Product 2 scanned → Image gets overlay badge "127"
    ↓
Progress updates: "Scanning 2 of 60... 2 products found"
    ↓
... continues for all products ...
    ↓
Scan complete → Progress modal fades out
    ↓
Results sent to Competitor Research page (SOLD items only)
```

## Visual Style CSS (Injected)

The overlays use inline styles for easy injection:

```css
/* Sold Count Overlay */
.ecomflow-sold-overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    background: rgba(40, 167, 69, 0.85);  /* Green with transparency */
    color: white;
    font-size: 32px;
    font-weight: bold;
    padding: 12px 24px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 80px;
    height: 80px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    animation: ecomflowPulse 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

/* Scan Progress Modal */
.ecomflow-scan-progress {
    position: fixed !important;
    top: 50% !important;
    left: 50% !important;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%) !important;
    z-index: 999999 !important;
    background: white !important;
    padding: 30px 40px !important;
    border-radius: 12px !important;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.3) !important;
}

/* Pulse Animation */
@keyframes ecomflowPulse {
    0% { transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.5); opacity: 0; }
    50% { transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1.1); }
    100% { transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1); opacity: 1; }
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge: Full support
- ✅ Firefox: Full support
- ✅ Safari: Full support (Manifest V3)
- ✅ Position fixed overlays work on all eBay pages
- ✅ Z-index 999999 ensures visibility over eBay's UI

## Performance Notes

- **Lightweight:** Overlays are pure CSS with minimal DOM manipulation
- **Non-blocking:** Overlay creation happens asynchronously
- **Memory-safe:** Progress modal is removed after scan completes
- **No conflicts:** Uses unique class names (`ecomflow-*`) to avoid CSS conflicts

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Overlays don't appear
- **Check:** Make sure you're on an eBay sold items page (URL has `LH_Sold=1`)
- **Check:** Products must have actual sold data
- **Solution:** Reload extension and try again

**Problem:** Progress modal doesn't hide
- **Check:** Scan may have errored out
- **Solution:** Refresh the eBay page or reload extension

**Problem:** Numbers are too small/large
- **Adjust:** Modify `font-size: 32px` in `addSoldCountOverlay()`
- **Adjust:** Modify `width/height: 80px` for badge size

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- 🎨 Color coding by sales volume (green=high, yellow=medium, red=low)
- 📊 Show daily sales rate on hover
- 🎯 Filter overlays by minimum sales threshold
- 💫 More animation options (fade, slide, bounce)
- 📱 Responsive sizing for different screen sizes
